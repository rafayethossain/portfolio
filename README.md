Did you know that 60% of project failures originate from inadequate requirements? Don't let that happen to you. For a successful project, you need to define the needs, and requirements, design, test the developed solution, and deliver value.

👉 As a Business Analyst, I play the role of a Digital Change Agent, enabling changes for your organization. My job is to guide the project from the beginning through the whole development process to the finishing stages. My Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering, including extensive knowledge of business processes, technologies, and best development practices, makes me a perfect fit to assist you with ventures of pretty much any complexity.

👉 I opted for software testing as a career because I believe in "destructive creation" and enjoy finding issues. I can help you implement test processes, and QA documentation, and provide end-to-end solutions for all types of testing.
